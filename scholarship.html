        <h2>Anna Lucile Brackbill</h2>

        <p>
          Anna Lucile Brackbill devoted her long life to service as a teacher,
          librarian, deacon, counselor, and friend. Orphaned at an early age,
          Lucile came to East Petersburg to live with her grandmother and aunt,
          where she laid the foundation for a life marked by learning, faith,
          and community involvement.
        </p>

        <p>
          She earned her librarian’s certificate from the New York Public Library
          School and began her professional career as a cataloger at Union
          Theological Seminary. Over the years, she served as librarian at
          several distinguished institutions, including Princeton University,
          the Reformed Theological Seminary in Lancaster, and Franklin &amp;
          Marshall College.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond her professional accomplishments, Lucile was deeply committed
          to volunteer service. She was both a volunteer and director of the
          Easter Seals Society and was actively involved in the Art Class, the
          Lancaster General Hospital Auxiliary, the East Petersburg Historical
          Society, and the Junior Auxiliary of Girls. Her generosity extended
          not only through her time and leadership, but also through financial
          support to these organizations and to her church, Trinity United
          Church of Christ.
        </p>

        <p>
          In recognition of her lifelong devotion to service and community, the
          East Petersburg Historical Society dedicated the central room of the
          Wolf House Museum to Anna Lucile Brackbill in 1998. The room features
          photographs representing the many stages of her remarkable life.
          Lucile lived to the age of 104, passing on May 24, 1995.

          </a>
        </p>

        <p>
          To honor her legacy, the East Petersburg Historical Society established
          the <strong>Anna Lucile Brackbill Memorial Fund</strong>, through which
          a student from Hempfield High School is selected each year to receive
          an award in her name.
